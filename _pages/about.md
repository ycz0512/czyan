Hi! My name is Changzhi Yan. I'm currently in my gap years as an "independent" researcher. I'm interested in reinforcement learning (RL), especially in theory.

Recently, I have finished my work on developing optimality guarantees for advantage-weighted regression (AWR), which is an iterative RL algorithm where the policy is updated using standard regression. If you want to know my research background through one paper, please check [this one](../assets/AWR_Guarantees.pdf).
