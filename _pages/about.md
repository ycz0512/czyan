Hi! I'm currently in my gap years as an "independent" researcher.    
I'm interested in reinforcement learning (RL), especially in theory.

Recently, I have finished my work on developing optimality guarantees for advantage-weighted regression (AWR), an iterative RL algorithm in which the policy is updated using standard regression. If you want to know my research background through one paper, please check [this](../assets/AWR_Guarantees.pdf).

I achieved my M.E. degree in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University, where I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Tao Zhang and Xueqian Wang. Prior to that, I achieved my B.E. degree in Automation at Hubei University of Technology.

You can find my CV [here](../assets/CV.pdf).

##I’m actively seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD degree in related areas.##
